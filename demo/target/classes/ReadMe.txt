To play:
    - run the server
    - join using the server's ip
    - if you are the first player to join the game, you can start the game.
    - if not, you need to wait


Client:
The Client sends a joingame request to the server, if the server accepts 
then the game will began. The client handles everything the player requests
no matter if it is legal or not. The client sends the info to the server. 
    Problems:
        Some problems encountered was sometimes I get confused on which things
        the server does and which things the client does and mix them up. 
    
    Unimplemented Features:
        We didn't have time to implement the actual images of the characters
        or the real terrain on the map. 

    Learning: 
        Github desktop and VScode is a thing
        A little understanding of Gson and Json
        Repository
        Http stuff
